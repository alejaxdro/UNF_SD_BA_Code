# UNF_SD_BA_Code
Senior Design back from college..

Team = 3 Electrical Engineering and 2 Mechanical Engineering Students

This project was used to program a Sphere Robot using a Beaglebone Black with wifi dongle, a usb sound card, Pololu IMU sensors, and a RoboClaw motor controller.
This robot was designed to be controlled via an Android App.

I'm redoing most this project as a base to learn/practice new technologies, especially since I got to keep the smaller robot prototype. Very little of the robot hardware will be modified. Link below.

Little prototype is using a ferret ball (giant hamster ball); Large prototype used a Boomer ball (designed for large animals) but ran into mechanical issues.
